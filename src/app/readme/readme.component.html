  <h2 class="readme-h2">A quick walkthrough</h2>
  <p>
      I prepared two versions of this frontend app. One is with Angular 7 and the 
      other one is with React.
    <br />
    I did not have the chance to work with Angular before this challenge. My usual 
    go-to frontend framework for my own projects is React. That is why I wanted to 
    prepare two versions: one with Angular and another with React as a fallback.
    <br />  
      This project was generated with 
      <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">Angular CLI</a> version 7.2.2.
  </p>
  <h1 class="readme-h1">Installation</h1>

    Unless you have Angular CLI installed already, 
    please do so for viewing the development build.

  <code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code>
  <p>
      After cloning solution repo to your computer,
      please run npm install since dependencies are not available in repo.
  </p>
