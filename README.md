# Angular Frontend Demo (Angular 7)

## [LiveDemo](https://gunes-angular-demo.herokuapp.com)


## A quick walkthrough

I prepared two versions of this frontend app. One is with Angular 7 and the other one is with React.

I did not have the chance to work with Angular before this challenge. My usual go-to frontend framework for my own projects is React. That is why I wanted to prepare two versions: one with Angular and another with React as a fallback.

*This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.2.*
